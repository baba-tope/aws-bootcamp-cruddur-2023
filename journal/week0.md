## Gathering Requirements, Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints (RRACs)

### Requirements
- verifiable
- monitorable
- traceable
- feasible**

### Risks
- Single Point of Failure (SPoF)
- User Commitment
- Late Delivery

### Assumptions
These are factors held as true for the planning & implementation phases
- Sufficient network bandwidth
- Stakeholders will be available to make decisions
- Budget is approved

### Constraints
- Time
- Budget
- Vendor Selection

## Create Designs

### Conceptual Design
- Created by business stakeholders and architects
- organizes and defines concepts and rules
- a.k.a. "Napkin Design" or "Whiteboard" because it is a sketch of basic working parameters

### Logical Design
- Defines how the system should be implemented
- Environment without actual names or sizes
- It is a blueprint. Example: undeployed CloudFormation Template (CFT)

### Physical Design
- Representation of the actual thing
- Includes graular details like IP addresses, Instance types


### Develop a Common Dictionary
- Ask "dumb" questions
- Play "Be-the-packet" - acting as an end-user throughout the workflows
- Document everything (you can't remember everything. Visual copies help!)
